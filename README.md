The **Australasian Computer Music Conference** will take place **July 3–11,
2020 as an online event**. 

ACMC is the annual gathering of the [Australasian Computer Music
Association](https://computermusic.org.au), a place to show and discuss research
and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It's a festival of
performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge,
and showcase our community.

This year’s conference theme is **inclusion**. We want to highlight the diverse
range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture
but may not normally attend an academic conference, including artists and
scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a
disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are
engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and
mainstream institutions.

The conference is hosted by the [ANU School of
Music](https://music.cass.anu.edu.au) and [Research School of Computer
Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au), [College of Engineering and Computer
Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au). Fun fact: ACMC was [last hosted in
Canberra](http://computermusic.org.au/conferences/acmc2010/) in 2010!

ACMC this year is free and has no registration fee.
