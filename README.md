The **Australasian Computer Music Conference** will take place **July 3–11,
2020**. ACMC is the annual gathering of the [Australasian Computer Music
Association](https://computermusic.org.au), a place to show and discuss research
and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It's a festival of
performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge,
and showcase our community.

This year’s conference theme is **inclusion**. We want to highlight the diverse
range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture
but may not normally attend an academic conference, including artists and
scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a
disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are
engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and
mainstream institutions.

The conference is hosted by the [ANU School of
Music](https://music.cass.anu.edu.au) and [Research School of Computer
Science](https://cs.anu.edu.au), [College of Engineering and Computer
Science](https://cecs.anu.edu.au). Fun fact: ACMC was [last hosted in
Canberra](http://computermusic.org.au/conferences/acmc2010/) in 2010!

Registration fees are to be confirmed, but we are committed to providing
low/no-cost access to ACMC for those who find that cost is a barrier for
participation.

selected by the conference organisers.

### Performances and Music

Composers and performers are invited to submit works in any style of
electroacoustic music including the following categories:

- performances/music involving live electronics, including computer processing

- laptop ensemble works

- live coding and algorave performances

- works combining musical instruments or voice with live or fixed media
  electronics, with up to 8 channels

- electroacoustic music for fixed media (up to 8 channels)

- video and multimedia works (up to 8 channels)

This call is open to all composers, regardless of nationality, age or career
stage. Composers of selected works are generally expected to attend the
conference.

### Installations

We invite site-specific installation works for locations at the Australian
National University School of Music, and Research School of Computer Science,
these will be installed for the duration of the conference. These could be sound
art works, multimedia works, sonic sculptures or self-playing systems.

### Research Papers & Artist Talks

We invite extended abstracts of up to 1000 words for research papers and artist
talks. These could relate to musical performances above or any of the topics
listed below. All extended abstracts will be subject to single-blind review by
at least two peer reviewers.

Accepted papers/talks will be presented in either short (10) or long (20
minutes) seminar format and the extended abstracts will be included in the
conference proceedings. Full versions of accepted papers will be invited for
further peer review and publication in Chroma, the journal of the Australasian
Computer Music Association.

### Workshops and Tutorials

We invite contributed workshops and tutorials to take place on Saturday 11 July
at the ANU School of Music. Workshops and tutorials could be about the topics
