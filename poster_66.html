<meta name="citation_abstract" content="The form:

This work is an interactive audio installation consisting of 8 channels of looped audio. 2 of the
channels are always on as a drone. The other 6 channels are faded in and out by people’s
interaction with the physical space. The physical form of the work consists of 6 fabric tents
which are suspended from the ceiling each with a light above it. Inside each of the tents is a
blanket and a weight sensor. When the weight sensor is activated, (usually by a human entering
one of the tents,) a message is sent to a pure data patch which turns the fades in the volume on
one of the 6 channels of audio. When a weight sensor is no longer active, (usually caused by a
human leaving one of the tents,) a message is sent to the same pure data patch which fades out
the volume of one of the 6 channels of audio.

The idea:

Blankets was conceived during a development program ran by You Are Here in 2019. The goal
of this development program was to investigate ways in which site-specific presentation of music
to create more inclusive ‘live’ music experiences. This idea was born out of a want to create a
communal space for people to experience music other than established concert and gig models.
Blankets was designed to lower or remove barriers to entry inherent to concert halls and gig
spaces.

Concert halls come with expected codes of behavior, knowing when to clap, what you are
supposed to wear, how to behave at intermission etc. These codes serve to alienate outsiders and
put up barriers to communal experience of music based on class, race and education.

Bars and other gig venues also have certain acceptable forms of behavior however tend to
exclude people based on other factors. Bars usually privilege male experiences, are always
dependent on alcohol and can create environments in which neurodivergent people feel uncomfortable.

Blankets is an installation designed to retain the communal aspect of experiencing music as a
collective while mitigating some of the alienating factors mentioned above. By having the
experience take place in a space without established rules of engagement the installation asks
people to engage in a new and different way. The piece allows for people to interact with the
space and others in the space on their own terms. Giving people the option to remove themselves
from the perception of others (by entering a tent), while still contributing to the overall
experience of the audience (entering a tent triggers audio). By giving people some control over
the soundscape and allowing them space to exist communally without the pressure to be social
the piece creates a new, more inclusive environment for people to experience sound in.

The audio:

The audio of this work was created specifically for this space. It consists of roughly 150 layers of
acoustic guitar playing very slight rhythmic variations on a 7-note pattern. These layers are
parried with shoegaze and drone influenced textural material. The sonic characteristics of this
work are designed to allow the audience to engage with them in a variety of different ways. The
audio on some levels is very simple, a repeated arpeggio pattern is played throughout, the same
harmony is repeated and the texture only changes very subtly. On other levels the audio is very
complex, the rhythmic content of the piece is very diverse including complex nested-tuplets and
poly rhythms and the texture is ever changing as dictated by audience members’ interactions with
the space. This creates a situation in which people can choose different ways of engaging with
the piece. Last time the piece was on display some people stayed inside for a relatively short
period of time, around 15 minutes, while others stayed for over an hour. The ability to engage
with the music in a range of different ways allowed for the piece to cater to a wide variety of
people. This plays into the themes of restoration and inclusivity inherent to the work.
