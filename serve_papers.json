That paper documented the \u201cComposer\u2019s Little Helper\u201d (CLH) which is a Max patcher that makes use of the \u201cBach\u201d and \u201cCage\u201d libraries to manipulate and mix musical notation that has been saved in a \u201cshelf\u201d as separate segments. CLH implements musical operations such as transposition, inversion, retrograde, plus a number of other \u201ctreatments\u201d that use the high-level \u201cCage\u201d library for real-time computer-aided composition.\n\nThe Composer\u2019s Little Helper was a non-realtime system to assist in the compositional process. In contrast, Vari-Gen is like the next generation development where a generative system is used to produce note information in realtime. Reading from a MIDI file, variations in pitch, onset time, durations and note velocity are produced and can be varied in realtime using a Markov methodology for each parameter independently.\n\nUsing the \u201cbach.roll\u201d representation of the original MIDI file, which is a musical staff with note-heads notated in proportional notation, the composer/performer can select a specific number of notes for treatment, vary the transposition, durations, onset times, velocities, and the order of the Markov chain for each parameter of the variation generator.\n\nRealtime output triggers sound using a VST instrument plugin, which can be varied to suit the musical style. The note output is recorded in another bach.roll object, which can be saved as a MIDI file at any time.\n\nIn essence, the system functions as an exotic sequencer/variation generator, and because it all happens in realtime, it could also function as a performance instrument.\n\nThe two part work Pierre and Frank was created using a combination of the Vari-Gen software and non-realtime editing (to be screened at ACMC 2020).","authors":"David Hirst","bandcamp":"","bio":"David Hirst\u2019s electroacoustic music compositions have been performed in the United States, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and nationally across Australia.

Although their life trajectories were quite different, one an orchestral conductor and the other a rock musician, their paths crossed through their compositional activities. Pierre Boulez founded the French research institute IRCAM in 1977 and conducted several tracks on the Zappa album The Perfect Stranger in 1984. It was performed by IRCAM\u2019s Ensemble InterContemporain, with the title track commissioned by Boulez. Zappa was also very active in his use of the Synclavier in his custom-built studio. The Synclavier was an early digital synthesizer, polyphonic digital sampling system, and music workstation manufactured by New England Digital Corporation of Norwich, Vermont. The original design and development of the Synclavier prototype occurred at Dartmouth College with the collaboration of Jon Appleton, Professor of Digital Electronics, Sydney A. Alonso, and Cameron Jones, a software programmer and student. Thus Boulez and Zappa were both highly active in the use of technology in their music.\nThe work is organized in two separate parts. The first part is dedicated to Pierre Boulez and is subtitled \u201cPierre\u201d. The second part is dedicated to Frank Zappa and is subtitled \u201cFrank\u201d. Both parts were created using the composer\u2019s variation generation Max patch called Vari-Gen (see separate presentation talk). The technique, in both cases, was to record a keyboard improvisation, edit it and dissect its constituents, and create variations on the segments using the variation generator software. Then each piece was assembled to create the final composition.\nParts 1 & 2 are quite different from each other in style. Part 1 (Pierre) is a more homogenous electronic style work, which is not really an emulation of a Boulez piece, but is a nod to his use of electronics. Part 2 (Frank) uses drums, bass, and a lead instrument in a form that begins with a solid drum back beat, then morphs into a duet between drums (percussion) and lead instruments, followed by a duet between lead and bass, before a final return to solid drum beat, bass line and lead synths. The bass instrument in Part 2 uses a software emulation of a Synclavier by the Arturia company. This is a nod to Zappa\u2019s use of the Synclavier later in his life. Part 2 is more in the phrenetic, relentless Zappa style. The production style is very retro!\n","authors":"David Hirst","bandcamp":"","bio":"David Hirst\u2019s electroacoustic music compositions have been performed in the United States, Canada, the UK, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea and nationally across Australia.

The composition explores the experience of music from perception to sensation; the physical process during which our sensory organs \u2013 those involved with sound, tactility, and vision in particular \u2013 respond to musically organized sound stimuli. Through this deep connection, sound, space, and audience are all engaged in a multidimensional experience. The motion and the meaning inherited in the sounds are not disconnected from the sounds and are not the reason for the sounds but are, in fact, the sound altogether. Energy, movement, and timbre become one; sound source identification, cause guessing, sound energies, gesture decoding, and extra-musical connotations are not independent of the sound but vital internal components of it. Qualia are claimed to be individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The way it feels to have mental states such as hearing frequencies at the lower threshold of human hearing or a piercing sound, hearing a Bb note from a ship horn, as well as the granularity of a recorded sound. It is an exploration of time and space, internal and universal. In Qualia, I do not experience musical memory as a sequence of instances but as a sensory wholeness that lasts the entire duration of the piece. The experience of sound itself is not sequential; it bypasses past or future; time becomes a single omnipresent unity. In this state of consciousness, time dissolves. The vibrating air molecules from the speakers, the reflections in the physical space, and the audience are the sound.","authors":"Panayiotis Kokoras","bandcamp":"","bio":"Kokoras is an internationally award-winning composer and computer music innovator, and currently an Associate Professor of composition and CEMI director (Center for Experimental Music and Intermedia) at the University of North Texas.

The images, live improvisation and recordings form a visual and aural installation to create an emotional and environmental response to the landscape and a sense of connection with the essence of the You Yangs.\n\nField recordings of the You Yang environment inform the \u201csonic postcard\u201d nature of Chromaticity\u2019s generative soundscape. Features such as the drone of a major highway, trains, a working quarry, children playing, bush-walking and mountain-bike riding area and other anthropogenic sounds are retained to reveal the current day sonic space.\n\nThe three images of the You Yangs, taken at dawn, meridian and dusk, reveal a dynamic and vivid spectrum of landscape colours. Each image informs a 5-minute movement of the work. A fourth image is projected directly onto the performer - in a sense, immersing them in the landscape.\n\nFor each image, parameters were assigned for sample and note duration, mode, tempo, sound density and pitch. The electromagnetic frequencies of the light spectrum were related to frequencies of sound waves and the saturation of colour determined the intensity of the sounds. Images were mapped and assigned notes with sounds of interest within the field recordings inspiring small motifs and cells to be sampled - performed on a range of instruments (Bass Clarinet, Taegum, Flute and small percussion instruments).\n\nA Max/MSP patch controls playback of field recordings associated with the time of day of each movement and provides a mechanism by which the sampled motifs and cells are triggered to form a harmonic backdrop for the clarinet improvisation. The contours of the landscape, as captured by Millen, are mapped to derive data input for control of parameters within the Max patch, and to suggest target notes for the clarinetist's improvisation in a small window within the patch. Thus, the patch containing this window, along with the images and mapping of their contours becomes a supplementary score for the performer to follow during live performance (along with the composer\u2019s notes describing tonality and motifs of each section).\n\nPremiere\nThe installation was premiered at the 4-hour Geelong After Dark pop-up arts festival held on Friday the 5th of May 2017 between 6 pm and 10 pm by the City of Greater Geelong.

There were numerous comments from the public wishing to reconnect and visit a place they hadn't visited in many years or decades, even though they see it on their daily horizon.\n\u2028\nThe event was free, and participation and interaction with the artists was encouraged.

This is achieved through multiple stochastic algorithms controlling various aspects of a performance, with curated specific states created by the artist. By giving control over some aspects of the performance to algorithmic generation, space is made for the artist to have clarity and focus on other musical elements. Magnetic Stripes simultaneously shows the subtlety of human performance and its effect on the experience, and the raw efficiency of machine generation. The generative elements of Magnetic Stripes are made obvious through musical and visual choices, yet are subtle in their control of the performance. All sound, visuals and controls are made with Cycling74\u2019s Max 8 software.\n\nThree probability-based algorithms have been designed for their distinctive effect on the respective musical elements they control. The algorithms are stochastic, but have been created with a rules-based mentality. They are a set of rules that manipulate percentage chances of upcoming musical choices that are inspired by the compositional work of John Cage and Brian Eno. They ensure no certainty in the performance, but possible controlled curves for the artist to react to.\n\nThe performance is a powerful, generative drone exploration. Eight channels of audio fuse together to create subtle ambience and moving sonic sweeps, in this contemplative 10-minute experience. They are six channels of simply affected wave table oscillators, and two noise generators. The resulting serene sound draws inspiration from musicians such as Todd Anderson-Kunert, Hobo Cubes and Ryoji Ikeda. The tones wash over the audience through their simplicity and medium movement. The changes in texture create moving sections and crescendos. Four of the oscillator drones (two triangle waves, one sawtooth and a square wave), feature algorithms that control their pitch, timbre and rhythm changes.\n\nA permutation probability algorithm generates pitch through curated percentages of likelihood. The proceeding notes are based on the preceding choices. For the square and sawtooth oscillators, this is a list of eight potential frequencies each, that are generated by the preceding three choices (starting with a random selection). The pitch choices are across a wide register for depth and variety. The two triangle oscillators have four potential choices, based on the preceding four selections (starting with a random selection). These frequencies are at the lower middle range to create a sense of warm\nundercurrents. The probability percentage lists are individually curated by the artist. The movement between them and the choices are generated by the machine. All of these drones have a second set multiplier that can be individually volume controlled by the artist, creating a possible thicker texture and harmony when necessary.\n\nThe timbre of each generative oscillator is manipulated by an algorithm\nthat prioritises selections based on how often they were made prior. The more a choice is made, the more likely it comes up in the future. Each drone has four potential shifts in the partials of the sound, that all start with equal chance of occurring, but the probabilities move and change, as the performance progresses (as with anything chance-based). This produces a sense of consistency over smaller blocks of time in the work, that the performer reacts to. The result is a feedback loop between performer and machine, that is different every time.\n\nThe rhythms of the drones are each controlled by curated, individual percentage-based probability algorithms. One for the length of each of the drones (four lists of percentages with four choices) and one for the space between each drone (four lists of percentages with four choices). These are set selections of percentages because Magnetic Stripes is meant to be deliberate, ambient and thought provoking.\n\nTwo additional sine wave channels have a constant pitch and no pulse. They create unity to the variety of constantly moving other drones. The sines have a second multiplier that can be controlled by the artist to add further texture. A white noise generator and a clicking-machine like texture (that is a blend of three separate beds); accompany the drones, to add body, where needed in the performance.\n\nThe aspects of Magnetic Stripes that the artist controls in real time are volume of each channel, the mix of each drone\u2019s harmonies, each drone\u2019s ADSR envelope, texture control (if a drone is on or off), and the panning between stereo outputs for each channel. These are musical elements that the artist determined should not be left up to chance, as they can create tension, build and shape to the performance.\n\nThe visuals are constantly changing, brightly coloured shapes, contrasted against a black background and space. They are generative and connected to the four algorithmic channels of audio. The sawtooth channel controls circular, radiating waves; the square drone controls grid-like rectangles with circular corners; the first triangle wave pushes and pulls multiple squares; and the second triangle channel controls haunting white bars and a simple red waveform. The audio of these channels dictates whether it\u2019s on screen and its volume controls their size. The artist\u2019s control of channel panning, determines the x axis starting point of each visual. The timbre changes determine if the visuals have a pixilation effect applied. This creates a sense of unity and synchronicity in the performance between the audio and the visuals.\n\nThe simplicity of the audio channels and the clear visual cues are used to highlight the algorithmic aspects to Magnetic Stripes and the performative controls of the artist. Gestural performative cues are created through audio-visual interaction. The piece sits somewhere between a curated experience, generative work and live performance. Algorithmic art usually either sits in an area of certain control of outcome or created with random at its core. However, in Magnetic Stripes, organisation and prioritisation of certain choices is balanced with chance to create a meaningful experience.","authors":"Matthew Davis (Nervous Playthng)","bandcamp":"","bio":"Nervous Plaything is an experimental composer, focusing on a textural experience using heavily effected guitars, synthesizers and artist developed technologies.

The work was initially conceived as a tribute to Chris Mann\u2019s life and oeuvre and published in Open Space Magazine as Two for Chris.\nThese Would Be Other morphs the ideas of tribute and present-day considerations. The text was delivered by Sophie Rose at different points of exposure to the poem, from initial reading to experienced live delivery. This supplies an increasing complexity in delivery, pitch, and tonality in the pre-recorded. This complexity is further amplified by Burke\u2019s echolalic audio distortions.

The piece is a sonic representation of the anxiety and unease invoked by climate change, particularly in light of the extreme weather events in Australia. The Disquiet Junto is a group created by author and sound artist Marc Weidenbaum as a weekly project where musicians respond to fast-turnaround assignments to compose and share compositions. This particular project (#419 - Dischoir) asked participants to create music from 113 vocal samples of held syllables shared by members of the Disquiet Junto. The field recording was made by freezing a hydrophone into a glass of water, then slowly pouring hot water over the frozen block. The vocal contributions were then layered on top of the field recording in Ableton Live 9. The resulting composition was turned into an audio visualisation using Trapcode Form in Adobe After Effects.
