  session: keynote-2

    Eve Klein is an award-winning composer, mezzo soprano, sound artist and
    academic. She designs large-scale, immersive art music experiences for
    festivals. Klein's music has been described as: "contemporary music at its
    most relevant – simultaneously inward and outward focused in addressing the
    challenge of its existence and its capacity to produce something great"
    (Cyclic Defrost).

    Drawing together traditional and experimental classical music, interactive
    performance art, and electronica, Klein pushes the boundaries of genre to
    find new ways of immersing contemporary audiences in art music forms. She
    holds a PhD in Music and Sound and is a Senior Lecturer at the University of
    Queensland.

    Eve's work has featured at international festivals and venues including MONA
    FOMA, VIVID Sydney, Brisbane Festival, Salisbury Cathedral, Burning Man,
    Underbelly Arts, the Melbourne Arts Centre and New York University. Eve's
    recordings have been released on Wood and Wire, New Weird Australia, and
    Feral Media. As a mezzo soprano she has appeared as a principal artist with
    Opera Australia and Pacific Opera. Eve is known for her electronic opera The
    Pomegranate Cycle which asks its audience to comprehend how women heal from
    violence. The album version has been downloaded over 60,000 times since its
    release.

    Eve's recent work explores the intersection of the body, technology, mass
    datasets and social justice. An example is Counting 2015, a multimedia work
    using crowdsourced video and collaboratively curated datasets to highlight
    the affective quality of numbers in online social justice campaigns. This
    work asked Facebook participants to reflect upon the human consequences of
    numbers they encounter online. In this way the composer acts as curator of a
    discussion in online communities, where participants are both audience
    members and performer-collaborators.

    Eve collaborates with festivals, scientists, artists and researchers to
    develop cross-disciplinary performance experiences. Eve's work Vocal Womb is
    an example of this practice, being the first work of its kind to deploy
    laryngoscopy during real time performances for a live audience. Vocal Womb
    allows its audience to explore the relationship between voice, identity and
    power by stepping into, and directly manipulating, the voice of another. The
    premier was called the "#1 coolest thing at MOFO 2018..." (Timeout Melbourne)
    and "One of the must-see music/art works of the 2018 festival... a deeply
    considered engagement with the history and traditions of opera" (The
    Conversation). The season sold out completely.

    Eve was awarded the 2020 Noisy Women Commission and is working with Ensemble
    Offspring to create a new composition teasing out the idea of "home" as the
    basis of a compassionate response to climate change. The music uses
    crowdsourced objects from people's past homes to create a public
    conversation about the personal consequences of climate inaction and to
    invite audiences to explore these themes as co-creators of the work.

    Klein is currently leading a VR/AR music research cluster at the University
    of Queensland where she is guiding postgraduate composers on the creation of
    virtual reality and augmented reality concert works and operas. Other
    research explores human computer interaction design and its impact on music
    performance and composition; classical music recording practices;
    environmental sound recording; and technology-enabled performance.
