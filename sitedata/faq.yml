    QA:
      - Question: How can I register for the conference?
        Answer: |
          The conference is free and there is no registration.

          If you want to get daily updates during the conference, join us on the [ACMA Mailing List](http://computermusic.org.au/acma-list/), on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/acma89), or on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/acma89).

          If you want to send us some money for all of our hard work, please consider [joining the Australasian Computer Music Association](http://computermusic.org.au/membership/) (membership starts at $30), a non-profit organisation dedicated to promoting learning, research, composition and performance of electronic, electro-acoustic and computer music in Australia and New Zealand.

      - Question: How do I attend the conference?
        Answer: |
          ACMC2020 is 100% online, you can attend by viewing this website, and joining us for live streamed events on YouTube. See "Access" above for more details.

      - Question: Why is the conference online?
        Answer: |
          The COVID-19 situation has resulted in uncertain social distancing requirements and travel restriction all around the world, in Canberra, and on ANU campus. 

          At this stage, it is not possible to hold in-person events at ANU or to expect visitors to travel to attend the conference.

          While this is disappointing, we have the opportunity to make ACMC2020 much more _inclusive_ by presenting the conference freely online to any interested participant in Australia and around the world.

          We should note that although we are able to to reconfigure the conference this way, 
          the computer music and music technology communities includes many folks who are primarily artists, 
          teachers, and casual workers who may have lost significant income due to social distancing measures. 
          Some members of the community who would normally participate in ACMC, or might have liked to, cannot participate this year due to 
          loss of work, funding, and studio or rehearsal space. We stand with these colleagues in the arts and 
          university communities in demanding better support for the arts and entertainment industries and 
          for vulnerable workers.

          All papers will be presented as pre-recorded videos (10 minutes).

          Your abstract will appear on the conference website.
 
          We will archive your paper presentations on YouTube for one month after the conference. If you would like to keep it online, please upload on your own account and send the link to us.

          We encourage you to archive your presentation on your own Youtube (or other) channel, and we will will link to it in our program.

      - Question: How are performances / music going to be presented?
        Answer: |
          We have three options for artistic works:

          - Presenting a 2-channel sound file to be available to stream on the conference website. This could be most appropriate for acousmatic and pre-rendered works 
        
          - Presenting a pre-recorded 2-channel + visuals video as part of a live-streamed concert that we will produce. This would be most appropriate for works with visual components or involving live performance.
          
          - Live streaming a performance from your location into our concert. This will be offered by invitation only and we will require a pre-recorded version as a backup.
          
          For all options, your edited program notes will be included as a blog post in the conference website.
          
          If you already have a pre-rendered version of your work (either audio or audio+visual), you are very welcome to simply contribute that to our pre-recorded program.
          
          Performances will be archived online on YouTube or SoundCloud for one month after the conference and removed after that. If you would like to keep it online, please upload on your own account and send the link to us.
      - Question: How long will you archive the audio and video of submissions?
        Answer: |
          We will provide an archive of audio (on Soundcloud) and video (on Youtube) for a month following the conference. After that time they will be removed.

          If you have your audio/video on your own account (on any streaming platform) we are happy to link to it from your submission page.

      - Question: Does the Australian Computer Music Association have a journal?
        Answer: |
          We are working on announcing a new journal for the Australian Computer Music Association soon! Details will appear here and on <https://computermusic.org.au> (by the time of the conference this year).

          The association has [published conference proceedings](http://computermusic.org.au/conferences/) in the past and used to have an "occasional" newsletter called _Chroma_ (1989--2006), but new times call for new ideas!
