      - Question: How are papers and artist talks going to be presented?
        Answer: |
          All papers will be presented as pre-recorded videos (10 minutes). 

          We will produce live-streamed presentation with each video  including time for questions over video or chat and a potential panel call to discuss the papers.
 
          Your abstract will appear on the conference website.
 
          We will archive your paper presentations on YouTube for one month after the conference. If you would like to keep it online, please upload on your own account and send the link to us.

          We encourage you to archive your presentation on your own Youtube (or other) channel, and we will will link to it in our program.

      - Question: How are performances / music going to be presented?
        Answer: |
          We have three options for artistic works:

          - Presenting a 2-channel sound file to be available to stream on the conference website. This could be most appropriate for acousmatic and pre-rendered works 
        
          - Presenting a pre-recorded 2-channel + visuals video as part of a live-streamed concert that we will produce. This would be most appropriate for works with visual components or involving live performance.
          
          - Live streaming a performance from your location into our concert. This will be offered by invitation only and we will require a pre-recorded version as a backup.
          
          For all options, your edited program notes will be included as a blog post in the conference website.
          
          If you already have a pre-rendered version of your work (either audio or audio+visual), you are very welcome to simply contribute that to our pre-recorded program.
          
          Performances will be archived online on YouTube or SoundCloud for one month after the conference and removed after that. If you would like to keep it online, please upload on your own account and send the link to us.
      - Question: How long will you archive the audio and video of submissions?
        Answer: |
          We will provide an archive of audio (on Soundcloud) and video (on Youtube) for a month following the conference. After that time they will be removed.

          If you have your audio/video on your own account (on any streaming platform) we are happy to link to it from your submission page.

      - Question: I need to get in touch with the conference organisers, how should I do that?
        Answer: "The best way to get in touch with us is via email to acmc2020@easychair.org"
