See \"Access\" above for more details.\n","Question":"How do I attend the conference?"},{"Answer":"The COVID-19 situation has resulted in uncertain social distancing requirements and travel restriction all around the world, in Canberra, and on ANU campus. \n\nAt this stage, it is not possible to hold in-person events at ANU or to expect visitors to travel to attend the conference.\n\nWhile this is disappointing, we have the opportunity to make ACMC2020 much more _inclusive_ by presenting the conference freely online to any interested participant in Australia and around the world.\n\nWe should note that although we are able to to reconfigure the conference this way, \nthe computer music and music technology communities includes many folks who are primarily artists, \nteachers, and casual workers who may have lost significant income due to social distancing measures. \nSome members of the community who would normally participate in ACMC, or might have liked to, cannot participate this year due to \nloss of work, funding, and studio or rehearsal space. We stand with these colleagues in the arts and \nuniversity communities in demanding better support for the arts and entertainment industries and \nfor vulnerable workers.\n","Question":"Why is the conference online?"}],"Section":"Registration"},{"QA":[{"Answer":"Here is the information for delivering your presentations and performance materials.\n\nFinal materials are due on 22/6/2020, although sending them through earlier would be great if possible.\n\nEach submission will require:\n\n- video of your presentation/performance or a sound file (link to dropbox or other file-sharing system)\n- edited abstract or program note\n- updated title as you want it to appear\n- updated author(s) name(s) as you want it to appear\n- a representative image for your paper or work (if available, also supplied through file sharing link)\n- streaming link to SoundCloud/Bandcamp/Youtube/Vimeo for your work or presentation (if available)\n- a link to your personal website, music website, or a public social media profile\n\nYou can provide this information in the following form: <https://forms.gle/Vd6BHM9HCk3RMF9Y7>\n\nPlease address any question to our EasyChair email address: [acmc2020@easychair.org](mailto:acmc2020@easychair.org) and one of the committee members will respond.\n","Question":"How do I submit my final abstract/performance?"},{"Answer":"We will transcode videos before streaming to our output resolution but you can provide videos in the following format to help us out: \n\n- 1920x1080 resolution @ 30FPS\n- H.264 codec\n- MP4 container\n- Only 2 audio channels will be supported\n","Question":"What format should my video file be?"},{"Answer":"We require a stereo uncompressed audio file in WAV format.\n","Question":"What format should my audio file be?"},{"Answer":"Only plain text or [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format is supported.\n\nPlease revise your abstract/program note to how you would like it to appear on the website and limit it to a maximum of 1000 words (shorter is also fine).\n","Question":"What format should my abstract or program notes be?"},{"Answer":"Please provide a JPEG image with a maximum width of 2000 pixels.\n","Question":"What format should my representative image be?"},{"Answer":"All papers will be presented as pre-recorded videos (10 minutes). \n\nWe will produce live-streamed presentation with each video  including time for questions over video or chat and a potential panel call to discuss the papers.\n\nYour abstract will appear on the conference website.\n\nWe will archive your paper presentations on YouTube for one month after the conference.
