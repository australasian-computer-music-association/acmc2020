<meta name="citation_abstract" content="The work is exploring social exclusion through the words, experiences and thoughts of victims and particularly children. The performance will draw on puppetry concepts where power relationships between the performer and the projected puppet are explored. The puppet will voice the words of the children while the performer will utilize wearable controllers to manipulate and process the audiovisual projections of the puppet. The performer will explore the gestural language of the puppeteer. The technological relationships in the work become a kind of metaphor for the power relationships that exist between the excluder and excluded, the manipulator and manipulated.

Social exclusion has significant impacts on victims and for most of us those experiences of exclusion can be painfully recalled and remembered vividly many years later. Neuroscience studies have shown that similar areas in the brain are activated when we experience physical and social pain. These experiences however also enable us to experience empathy and to understand and protect others when we witness injustices occurring. This piece explores these social experiences through the use of technology and is the necessary corollary to the conference theme of inclusion for in order to understand inclusion we must understand exclusion.

I have been working with wearable controllers for a number of years and in 2019 undertook a residency at the Joan Sutherland Centre where I began to work on a project called the Digital Marionette. The residency offered the opportunity to explore the relationship between the puppet and the puppeteer and the correlations between the composer performer and how these relationships are broken down through contemporary practice and the use of technology. The work proposed for this 2020 ACMC draws on ideas developed during the residency and adapts these to fit the conference theme." />

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>The work is exploring social exclusion through the words, experiences and thoughts of victims and particularly children. The performance will draw on puppetry concepts where power relationships between the performer and the projected puppet are explored. The puppet will voice the words of the children while the performer will utilize wearable controllers to manipulate and process the audiovisual projections of the puppet. The performer will explore the gestural language of the puppeteer. The technological relationships in the work become a kind of metaphor for the power relationships that exist between the excluder and excluded, the manipulator and manipulated.</p>
<p>Social exclusion has significant impacts on victims and for most of us those experiences of exclusion can be painfully recalled and remembered vividly many years later. Neuroscience studies have shown that similar areas in the brain are activated when we experience physical and social pain. These experiences however also enable us to experience empathy and to understand and protect others when we witness injustices occurring. This piece explores these social experiences through the use of technology and is the necessary corollary to the conference theme of inclusion for in order to understand inclusion we must understand exclusion.</p>
<p>I have been working with wearable controllers for a number of years and in 2019 undertook a residency at the Joan Sutherland Centre where I began to work on a project called the Digital Marionette. The residency offered the opportunity to explore the relationship between the puppet and the puppeteer and the correlations between the composer performer and how these relationships are broken down through contemporary practice and the use of technology.

<h4>Bio</h4>

<p>Dr. Donna Hewitt is a vocalist, electronic music composer and instrument designer.
Donna’s research has been primarily exploring mediatized performance environments and
new ways of interfacing the voice with electronic media. She is the inventor of the eMic, a
sensor enhanced microphone stand for electronic music performance and more recently
has been creating wearable electronics for controlling both sound and lighting in
performance. Her work has attracted funding from the Australia Council for the Arts, most
recently with all female collective Lady Electronica. Her collaborative work spans
electronic and acousmatic music, music for theatre and dance, spatial audio and networked
improvised performance most recently with the Ethernet Orchestra and the Female Laptop
Orchestra. Donna has held academic positions at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and
Queensland, University of Technology and is currently the Coordinator of Bachelor of Music
at the University of New England, Sydney Australia.</p>
