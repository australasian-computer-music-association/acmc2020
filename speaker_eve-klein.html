<!--         <h4>Abstract</h4>
        Eve Klein is an award-winning composer, mezzo soprano, sound artist and
academic. She designs large-scale, immersive art music experiences for
festivals. Klein’s music has been described as: “contemporary music at its
most relevant---simultaneously inward and outward focused in addressing the
challenge of its existence and its capacity to produce something great”
(Cyclic Defrost). Drawing together traditional and experimental classical
music, interactive performance art, and electronica, Klein pushes the
boundaries of genre to find new ways of immersing contemporary audiences in
art music forms. She holds a PhD in Music and Sound and is a Senior Lecturer
at the University of Queensland.

        <h4>Bio</h4>
        Eve Klein is an award-winning composer, mezzo soprano, sound artist and
academic. She designs large-scale, immersive art music experiences for
festivals. Klein's music has been described as: "contemporary music at its
most relevant – simultaneously inward and outward focused in addressing the
challenge of its existence and its capacity to produce something great"
(Cyclic Defrost).

Drawing together traditional and experimental classical music, interactive
performance art, and electronica, Klein pushes the boundaries of genre to
find new ways of immersing contemporary audiences in art music forms. She
holds a PhD in Music and Sound and is a Senior Lecturer at the University of
Queensland.

Eve's work has featured at international festivals and venues including MONA
FOMA, VIVID Sydney, Brisbane Festival, Salisbury Cathedral, Burning Man,
Underbelly Arts, the Melbourne Arts Centre and New York University. Eve's
recordings have been released on Wood and Wire, New Weird Australia, and
Feral Media. As a mezzo soprano she has appeared as a principal artist with
Opera Australia and Pacific Opera. Eve is known for her electronic opera The
Pomegranate Cycle which asks its audience to comprehend how women heal from
violence. The album version has been downloaded over 60,000 times since its
release.

Eve's recent work explores the intersection of the body, technology, mass
datasets and social justice. An example is Counting 2015, a multimedia work
using crowdsourced video and collaboratively curated datasets to highlight
the affective quality of numbers in online social justice campaigns. This
work asked Facebook participants to reflect upon the human consequences of
numbers they encounter online. In this way the composer acts as curator of a
discussion in online communities, where participants are both audience
members and performer-collaborators.

Eve collaborates with festivals, scientists, artists and researchers to
develop cross-disciplinary performance experiences. Eve's work Vocal Womb is
an example of this practice, being the first work of its kind to deploy
laryngoscopy during real time performances for a live audience. Vocal Womb
allows its audience to explore the relationship between voice, identity and
power by stepping into, and directly manipulating, the voice of another. The
premier was called the "#1 coolest thing at MOFO 2018..." (Timeout Melbourne)
and "One of the must-see music/art works of the 2018 festival... a deeply
considered engagement with the history and traditions of opera" (The
Conversation). The season sold out completely.

Eve was awarded the 2020 Noisy Women Commission and is working with Ensemble
Offspring to create a new composition teasing out the idea of "home" as the
basis of a compassionate response to climate change. The music uses
crowdsourced objects from people's past homes to create a public
conversation about the personal consequences of climate inaction and to
invite audiences to explore these themes as co-creators of the work.

Klein is currently leading a VR/AR music research cluster at the University
of Queensland where she is guiding postgraduate composers on the creation of
virtual reality and augmented reality concert works and operas. Other
research explores human computer interaction design and its impact on music
performance and composition; classical music recording practices;
environmental sound recording; and technology-enabled performance.
