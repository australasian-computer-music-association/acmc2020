# Media folder

Here's the deal:

1. video files go in this folder, with the filename `UID.{mp4,mkv,mov}`

2. run the script

3. when complete (might take a while) the output will be in `processed/output.mkv`

## TODO

- [ ] provide a way of specifying the order of the pieces in a session

- [ ] handle audio-only pieces (add the title card, but leave it up for the whole thing)
